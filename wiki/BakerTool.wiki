#summary Baker Tool Overview

= Introduction =

The baker tool is a command-line tool that allows you to capture detail attributes from high resolution meshes and bake them into textures, so that they can be applied to lower resolution surfaces.

Source code for the baker tool can be found here:

http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-mesh-tools/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/nvmesh/tools/baker

The NVIDIA baker tool supports some unique features not available in other similar tools:

  * Support for different kind of base surfaces, including various subdivision surface approximations, such as Bezier ACC, Gregory ACC, and Pm patches.
  * Capture details using dual parameterizations instead of raycasting. This imposes some constraints on the input assets, but produces much higher quality results.
  * Support for vector displacement maps.


= Command-line Options =

== General Options ==

  * *--width* - Width of the output textures. _Defaults to 1024_.
  * *--height* - Height of the output textures. _Defaults to 1024_.
  * *--threads* - Number of threads to be used to compute ambient occlusion. _Default to 0, which chooses a number equal to the number of processors_.
  * *--output* - File name prefix for the generated textures. _Defaults to "output"_.

== Base Pass Options ==

  * *--lomesh* - File name of the base mesh.
  * *--losub* - Subdivision levels applied to the base mesh. _Defaults to 0_.
  * *--lomode* - Mode of the base mesh: 
    * 0 = Bezier ACC surface. _(default)_
    * 1 = Gregory ACC surface.
    * 2 = Triangular mesh.
  * *--disp3D* - Generate vector displacements.
  * *--tangentSpace* - Generate normals and vector displacements in tangent space.

== Detailed Pass Options ==

  * *--himesh* - File name of the detailed mesh.
  * *--hisub* - Subdivision levels applied to the detailed mesh. _Defaults to 0_.
  * *--hidisp* - Displacement map for detailed mesh.
  * *--hinmap* - Normal map for detailed mesh.
  * *--hisupersampling* - Enable supersampling. _Disabled by default_.
  * *--hipos* - Output position map.
  * *--occlusion* - Output occlusion map.
  * *--bentnormal* - Output bent normal map.
  * *--rays* - Number of rays to compute ambient occlusion. _Defaults to 64_.
  * *--maxdistratio* - Maximum occlusion distance with respect to the mesh size. _Defaults to 0.25_.
  * *--ilmocclusion* - Use binary occlusion instead of attenuated visibility.
  * *--hicachedir* - Directory for saving and reading the cached data.
  * *--rebuildcache* - Load original data and recompute cache.
