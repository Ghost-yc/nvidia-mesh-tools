#summary Baker Tool Overview

= Introduction =

The baker tool is a command-line tool that allows you to capture detail attributes from high resolution meshes and bake them into textures, so that they can be applied to lower resolution surfaces.

Source code for the baker tool can be found here:

The NVIDIA baker tool supports some unique features not available in other similar tools:

  * Support for different kind of base surfaces, including various subdivision surface approximations, such as Bezier ACC, Gregory ACC, and Pm patches.
  * Capture details using dual parameterizations instead of raycasting. This imposes some constraints on the input assets, but produces much higher quality results.
  * Support for vector displacement maps.


= Command-line Options =

== General Options ==

  * *--width* - Width of the output textures. _Defaults to 1024_.
  * *--height* - Height of the output textures. _Defaults to 1024_.
  * *--threads* - Number of threads to be used to compute ambient occlusion. _Default to 0, which chooses a number equal to the number of processors_.
  * *--output* - File name prefix for the generated textures. Defaults to "output".
